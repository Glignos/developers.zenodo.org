# Rate Limiting


For our content and services to be available to everyone we have to make sure that our resources are being distributed fairly. 
To achieve this, we have rate-limiting measures in place which limit the number of requests users can perform in a time window. Depending on the complexity and load of each request, different endpoints have different limits configured.
